tables: 
users (username, name, email, password, profile_pic, hometown),
children (child_id, parent_id, child_dob),
places (place_id, name, type_of_place, location, address, overall_rating), 
**amenities (amenity, description),  
typeOfPlace (slug, description),
reviews (review_id, place_id, rating, review_text, created_at)

thoughts:
how to make sure places aren't duplicated/uploaded more than once on to the map...
what is the best format for review score? Eg. should it be between 1 and 10, 1 and 5 or just a thumbs up or thumbs down?
