tables: 
users (username, name, email, password, profile_pic, hometown),
children (child_id, parent_id, child_dob),
places (place_id, name, type_of_place, location, address, overall_rating), 
**amenities (amenity, description),  
typeOfPlace (type, description),
reviews (review_id, place_id, rating, review_text, created_at)

thoughts:
how to make sure places aren't duplicated/uploaded more than once on to the map...
what is the best format for review score? Thumbs up or thumbs down on the place itself. 
make sure that each username is unique, a patch request will not work if username is not unique 
make sure email is correct format otherwise give an error
will overall rating be calculated on the frontend or the backend? BACKEND
We will want to limit the amount of characters people can use in the review
